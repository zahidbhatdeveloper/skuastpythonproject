# Tree Chemical Evaluation Project

This project provides tools for analyzing and evaluating chemical properties of trees. It allows for the analysis of various chemical compounds and properties found in different tree species.

## Features
- Chemical compound analysis
- Tree species comparison
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis of chemical properties

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python tree_chemical_analysis.py
```

## Project Structure
- `tree_chemical_analysis.py`: Main script for chemical analysis
- `data/`: Directory for storing tree chemical data
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Data Format
The project expects chemical data in CSV format with the following columns:
- Tree Species
- Chemical Compound
- Concentration
- Measurement Date
- Location
