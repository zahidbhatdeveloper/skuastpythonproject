# Tree Disease Analysis System - Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Tree Disease Analysis System is a computer vision-based solution for detecting and analyzing diseases in trees, with a particular focus on fruit trees. The system uses image processing techniques and color analysis to identify various disease symptoms and provide detailed analysis reports.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Image Processing Pipeline
```python
class TreeDiseaseAnalyzer:
    def analyze_image(self, image_data: bytes, tree_id: str = None)
```
- Input: Raw image data in bytes format
- Output: Comprehensive analysis report
- Process:
  1. Image decoding and validation
  2. HSV color space conversion
  3. Feature extraction
  4. Disease detection
  5. Report generation

#### 2. Disease Detection System
The system currently supports detection of four major diseases:
1. **Apple Scab**
   - Description: Fungal disease causing dark, scabby lesions
   - Severity Levels: Low, Moderate, Severe
   - Treatment: Fungicide application, leaf removal, air circulation improvement

2. **Black Rot**
   - Description: Fungal disease with circular brown/black spots
   - Severity Levels: Low, Moderate, Severe
   - Treatment: Pruning, copper-based fungicide, sanitation

3. **Powdery Mildew**
   - Description: White powdery coating on leaves
   - Severity Levels: Low, Moderate, Severe
   - Treatment: Sulfur-based fungicide, air circulation, watering management

4. **Cedar Apple Rust**
   - Description: Bright orange spots on leaves
   - Severity Levels: Low, Moderate, Severe
   - Treatment: Cedar tree removal, fungicide, resistant varieties

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Color Analysis
```python
color_ranges = {
    "healthy_green": ([35, 50, 50], [85, 255, 255]),
    "yellow_spots": ([20, 100, 100], [30, 255, 255]),
    "brown_lesions": ([10, 60, 60], [20, 255, 255]),
    "white_powder": ([0, 0, 200], [180, 30, 255])
}
```
- Uses HSV color space for better color segmentation
- Defines specific color ranges for different disease symptoms
- Calculates percentage of each color in the image

### 2. Disease Detection Algorithm
```python
def _analyze_image_features(self, img, hsv):
    # Disease detection thresholds
    if results["color_analysis"]["brown_lesions"] > 10:
        # Black rot detection
    if results["color_analysis"]["white_powder"] > 15:
        # Powdery mildew detection
    if results["color_analysis"]["yellow_spots"] > 12:
        # Cedar apple rust detection
```
- Uses color-based thresholds for initial detection
- Calculates confidence scores based on symptom coverage
- Determines severity levels based on confidence scores

### 3. Texture Analysis
```python
def _calculate_texture_features(self, gray_img):
    # Gradient-based features
    dx = cv2.Sobel(gray_img, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=kernel_size)
    dy = cv2.Sobel(gray_img, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=kernel_size)
```
- Calculates gradient-based texture features
- Measures contrast, smoothness, and uniformity
- Helps in distinguishing between similar-looking symptoms

### 4. Affected Area Analysis
```python
def _identify_affected_areas(self, img, hsv, disease_name):
    # Disease-specific color ranges
    if disease_name == "black_rot":
        lower = np.array([10, 60, 60])
        upper = np.array([20, 255, 255])
```
- Calculates percentage of affected area for each detected disease
- Uses disease-specific color ranges
- Provides quantitative measure of disease spread

## Analysis Report Structure

### 1. Basic Information
```json
{
    "timestamp": "ISO format timestamp",
    "image_path": "path to analyzed image",
    "analysis_summary": {
        "healthy_tissue_percentage": float,
        "number_of_diseases_detected": integer,
        "overall_health_status": "Healthy/Requires Attention"
    }
}
```

### 2. Disease Detection Results
```json
{
    "detected_diseases": [
        {
            "name": "disease_name",
            "confidence": float,
            "severity": "Low/Moderate/Severe"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 3. Technical Analysis
```json
{
    "color_analysis": {
        "healthy_green": float,
        "yellow_spots": float,
        "brown_lesions": float,
        "white_powder": float

## Usage Example

```python
from tree_disease_analyzer import TreeDiseaseAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = TreeDiseaseAnalyzer()

# Read image file
with open('tree_image.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    image_data = f.read()

# Analyze image
report = analyzer.analyze_image(image_data, tree_id='T001')

# Process results
print(f"Healthy tissue: {report['analysis_summary']['healthy_tissue_percentage']}%")
for disease in report['detected_diseases']:
    print(f"Detected {disease['name']} with {disease['confidence']}% confidence")
```

## Performance Considerations
